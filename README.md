# EC2 Remediation System

This repository contains the implementation of the **EC2 Monitoring and Remediation System** built on ServiceNow.  
The project integrates with a simulated AWS Integration Server to automatically monitor EC2 instance health,  
trigger workflows when failures are detected, and allow DevOps engineers to manually remediate instances  
through a one-click UI Action.
