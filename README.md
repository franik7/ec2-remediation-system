# EC2 Monitoring and Remediation System ‚Äì ServiceNow Implementation

## System Overview
This project implements the **ServiceNow portion** of an EC2 Monitoring and Remediation System.  
The purpose is to provide Netflix‚Äôs DevOps team with a **centralized response system** that:  
- Detects when an EC2 instance fails (status = OFF)  
- Automatically triggers workflows in ServiceNow  
- Provides AI-powered remediation guidance from the Knowledge Base  
- Sends Slack notifications to alert engineers in real time  
- Allows engineers to remediate the instance with a **one-click UI Action**  
- Logs every remediation attempt in a dedicated table for auditing

## Implementation Steps
The ServiceNow portion included these key components:

1. **Custom Tables**  
   - `EC2 Instance` ‚Äì stores instance name, ID, and status (`ON` or `OFF`).  
   - `Remediation Log` ‚Äì tracks remediation attempts, payloads, responses, status codes, and success flags.

3. **UI Action** ‚Äì *Trigger EC2 Remediation*  
   - Added as a form button on EC2 Instance records.  
   - Executes client-side script using GlideAjax.

4. **Script Include** ‚Äì *EC2RemediationHelper*  
   - Handles outbound REST requests via the Connection & Credential Store (CCS).  
   - Reads instance ID, calls the AWS Integration Server, and inserts log entries.

5. **Flow Designer Workflow**  
   - Trigger: When EC2 Instance status updates to OFF.  
   - Actions:  
     - Create log record  
     - Run AI Search against Knowledge Base  
     - Post Slack notification via webhook

6. **Knowledge Base Integration**  
   - Created KB article ‚ÄúEC2 Remediation when OFF‚Äù with keywords for AI Search discoverability.  

   üì∏ Published KB article content. ![Published KB article content](assets/kb_article.png)   

7. **Connection & Credential Store**  
   - Alias: *AWS Integration Server C C Alias*  
   - Connection: Host + base path `/api/v1/queue/start`  
   - Credential: Basic Auth (admin user)

## Architecture Diagram
The workflow is illustrated below:

Flow of events:  
1. AWS Integration Server updates ServiceNow EC2 Instance table.  
2. Flow triggers when status = OFF.  
3. AI Search retrieves KB article.  
4. Slack webhook sends alert with KB link.  
5. Engineer clicks remediation UI Action.  
6. Script Include executes REST call.  
7. Remediation Log updated.  
8. Instance status returns to ON.

## Optimization

During implementation, the following improvements were applied for reliability and efficiency:  
- **Scoped Application**: Ensured naming conventions matched AWS Integration Server requirements (`x_snc_ec2_monito_0`).  
- **Error Handling (pre-built)**: Script Include captures and logs all error responses (`400`, `401`, `404`) with payload.  
- **Slack Messaging**: Used `<URL|label>` formatting to shorten links and improve readability.  
- **Incident Tracking**: Added a custom *EC2 Monitoring Incidents* table. Every time an EC2 instance goes OFF, a new incident record is automatically created.  
- **SLA Enforcement**: Defined a 30-second SLA (for testing) for the remediation on the incident table. If the instance status returns to **ON** within that period:  
  - the incident in the *EC2 Monitoring Incidents* table is auto-closed, and  
  - a Slack message is sent: *‚ÄúThe issue has been remediated‚Äù*.  
  If the status remains **OFF**, the incident stays open for manual follow-up.

## DevOps Usage
For Netflix DevOps engineers, the workflow is:  

1. **Detection**:  
   EC2 instance status is auto-updated in ServiceNow. If OFF, a Slack alert is sent.  

2. **Guidance**:  
   Slack message contains a direct link to the relevant KB article with remediation instructions.  

3. **Remediation**:  
   Engineer opens the EC2 Instance record and clicks the **Trigger EC2 Remediation** button.  

4. **Execution**:  
   Script Include executes outbound REST ‚Üí AWS Integration Server.  

5. **Audit**:  
   Remediation Log captures the attempt, payload, response, and success flag.
